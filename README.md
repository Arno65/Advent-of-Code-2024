# Advent-of-Code-2024

This repository contains some of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024.\
My main programming language is Haskell. I'll also do some work in Clojure and C++. \
I'm programming in Clojure to gain experience. \
My son is learning C++ and to help him I am brushing up on my C++ knowledge myself.
That's why here and there is a C++ program.

For collecting the stars I will first code the solution in the language that works best for me. 
Most of the time that will be Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.\
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2024 account.

Day 1 to 9 have solutions in Haskell.\
Day 1,2,3 and 8 have solutions in CLojure.\
Day 1 and 6 have solutions in C++.\

Happy coding!
